This project lets play the dino game by measuring the distance between your hand and the ultrasonic sensor.

The project is separated into 2 sections: 
1)Arduino code: 
lets you measure the distance and if it is greater than a certain threshold (15 cm) a serial command is sent ( letter 'J')
2)Python code: 
Intercepts the serial buffer and stores it in a variable.
if the serial buffer corresponds to the command ('J'), a keyboard command will be sent: space (' ').


libraries needed: 
pyserial : pip install pyserial 
PyAutoGUI: pip install pyautogui
Materials: 
Any Arduino board 
Ultrasonic sensor
jumper wires 

this is were you can find the game :
